We currently have five workshops that we run throughout each of our Reactor locations around the world.  

| Workshop | Description | Learning Resource |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Introduction to Python for Data Science | "Data enables us to understand the world around us. Whether we're gathering data about our natural world to understand how it is changing, or analyzing patterns in how societies grow and change to ensure we're supporting all people, data is what drives the conversation. In this one-day workshop, we invite you to take the first step to learning how to understand data. With the power of Python, you will be able to explore data more quickly and develop more complex learnings from that data with just a few lines of code. Step 1: Learn the basics of Python coding and understand how it can be used to digest large data sets. | [Learning Materials Found at: aka.ms/DataScience1](https://aka.ms/DataScience1) |
| Beginners Data Science for Python Developers | Every day new data is created. New parts are made and shipped from factories, people continuously tweet, and companies grow and fluctuate causing major changes in the market. With the addition of more data comes the difficulty of being able to process that data. As humans, we can understand complex scenarios, but computers are much better at being able to analyze large datasets. In this workshop, you will get a glimpse into how we can teach machines to analyze complex scenarios at a much larger scale than we're able to. After you've cleaned and organized your data, you will have an opportunity to train and test machine learning models, and even publish your predictor online for others to explore. | [Learning Materials Found at: aka.ms/DataScience2](https://aka.ms/DataScience2) |
| Making Your Data Useful for Analysis | Having complete and accurate data is a critical first step to being able to learn from it, but part of the complexity of data science is narrowing down what part of the data is important. In this introductory workshop to Machine Learning you will begin to understand how to narrow down the feature scope of your data so that the predictions are based on causation and not just correlation. | [Learning Materials Found at: aka.ms/MachineLearning1](https://aka.ms/MachineLearning1) |
| Using Advanced Machine Learning Models | What happens when you encounter large data sets that are more nuanced than a set of concrete numbers? When you begin to explore natural language, or data sets with many potential influential features, you require more complex and predictive machine learning models. In this advanced Data Science workshop, learn about K-Means, Naive Bayes, and Regression models that will better support complex data and questions.  | [Learning Materials Found at: aka.ms/MachineLearning2](https://aka.ms/MachineLearning2) |
| Building Software That Recognizes You | Are you a developer who is curious how your computer or phone recognize it's you and not your sibling when you try to unlock the device? With the power of Azure artificial intelligence (Cognitive Services) and your existing coding powers, we invite you to join us on a Python+Flask+Azure journey to build your very own smart app! | [Learning Materials Found in This Repo at: Artifical Intelligence 1_Building Software That Recognizes You](Artifical%20Intelligence%201_Building%20Software%20That%20Recognizes%20You/) |
