`Data/noaa_volerup.csv`  
In this Notebook. 

## Tasks
Using what you know about Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Machine Learning you sould:
- Idenfity requirements for success
- Identify possible risks in the data if this were a real-world scenario
- Prepare the data
- Select features (variables)
- Split the data between training and testing
- Choose algorithms

## Options
If you would prefer to find your own dataset, that is OK, however limit your searching to about 15 minutes. Microsoft has several [Public Datasets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-public-data-sets) if you want to start there. 

You are also encouraged to explore any aspects of the data. Be explicit about your inquiry and success in predicting affects on our world.
